//! Image dimensional flipper

//! A utility proxy for the ImageRS "Image" trait that maps the width
//! to the original height, and vice versa, as well as every x to y
//! and vice versa.
//!
//! This has the effect of making it possible to treat each column in a
//! horizontal scan as a continguous block, that is, the way a row is
//! usually represented in memory.
//!
//! These algorithms treat the image as a read-only source, and the
//! intermediate products can have any representation sufficient to
//! perform the necessary computation.  By virtually "flipping" the
//! image 90Â°, we can break the receiving "row" by chunks_mut and
//! update each chunk in a separate thread without having to do
//! anything unsafe.
